HTML5 + CSS3 + JavaScript templates

The idea of this web site template was just to try some features in HTML5 and CSS3. I also added the page with a Google Map that helped me to understand how to work with Google Maps APIs. 

##Some of the features

* Adaptive layout 
* Layout can be scaled
* Mobile first approach
* Responsive images
* Animations on the two pages
* Embeded YouTube video
* CSS reset used to remove all default properties
* Tags <section> used to display pictures in specific position on the main page
* CSS3 Transition changed property of the pics


##Tested in Browsers
* Google Chrome Version 59.0.3071.115
* Safari Version 10.1.1
* Microsoft Edge
