  <h1>The best hotels in Nantwich</h1>
  


  <p>The origins of the settlement date to Roman times, when salt from Nantwich was used by the Roman garrisons at Chester (Deva Victrix) and Stoke-on-Trent as both a preservative and a condiment. Salt has been used in the production of Cheshire cheese and in the tanning industry, both products of the dairy industry based in the Cheshire Plain around the town. <a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">"Nant" comes from the Welsh for brook or stream. Wich and wych are names used to denote brine springs or wells.</a> In 1194 there is a reference to the town as being called Nametwihc, which would indicate it was once the site of a pre-Roman Celtic nemeton or sacred grove.</p>
